Open Platform Communications (OPC) and OPC UA (Unified Architecture) are standards that facilitate the exchange of data between programmable logic controllers (PLC), human-machine interfaces (HMI), servers, clients and other machinery for the purpose of interconnectivity and circulation of information. This kind of interconnectivity and communication is obviously essential in a production plant, since there are numerous types of equipment, devices and machinery that measure process parameters, data, data or record it.
This mobile application is a demo version developed to show the potential of the OPC UA standard, you can read, set sensors and actuators with just a mobile App!
The app makes use of the official Java stack provided by the OPC Foundation at the following url: https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-Java-Legacy, this stack java is no longer supported today so the application may stop working in future release of the standard. In addition, the application uses a self-signed certificate, therefore problems may arise in the connection to servers that use Sign or Sign&Encrypt authentication.
